# Project 13

## Description

This project is a simple "Maze Solver". The program allows the user to input a maze in the form of a 2D grid, and the program finds the shortest path from the start to the end point using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

## Tools Needed

- GCC Compiler
- Text Editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- Terminal/Command Prompt

## How to Run

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
3. Compile the code using the GCC compiler with the following command:
   ```
   gcc -o maze_solver maze_solver.c
   ```
4. Run the compiled program with the following command:
   ```
   ./maze_solver
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the maze and find the shortest path.
